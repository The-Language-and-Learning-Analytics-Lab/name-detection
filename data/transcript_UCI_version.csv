0:07:14,0:07:15,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,But yeah.

0:09:29,0:09:46,a1958a61-a8ce-4002-9980-c66db01f95fe," i'm for the project, I was a little confused so there's there's 15 days on the schedule for the projects, but because our slot has the project before the tutorial like they were saying that we shouldn't meet during the time on the first day."
0:09:47,0:09:49,fa3e5f86-2b2d-49aa-a214-9a84ff89e3bb,That we were you were.
0:09:49,0:09:53,fa3e5f86-2b2d-49aa-a214-9a84ff89e3bb,Seeing very seeing that the project is before the tutorial.
0:09:54,0:09:54,a1958a61-a8ce-4002-9980-c66db01f95fe,Oh.
0:09:54,0:09:57,a1958a61-a8ce-4002-9980-c66db01f95fe,My calendar Where are you slide five.

0:10:01,0:10:04,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,it's not for its first project and tutorials.
0:10:05,0:10:07,fa3e5f86-2b2d-49aa-a214-9a84ff89e3bb,Wait okay why isn't my calendar show that.
0:10:09,0:10:17,fa3e5f86-2b2d-49aa-a214-9a84ff89e3bb,So on the fifth I see intro 1pm tutorials and then a break and then tutorials and unnatural.
0:10:17,0:10:20,a1958a61-a8ce-4002-9980-c66db01f95fe,I don't think project times are on the calendar.
0:10:20,0:10:21,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,yeah probably.
0:10:21,0:10:23,fa3e5f86-2b2d-49aa-a214-9a84ff89e3bb,Are they not go ahead yeah.
0:10:23,0:10:24,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,it's before.

0:10:26,0:10:37,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58," But, but still I think you need to enter to open the zoom link for them and do your like little guidance, the 3040 minutes."
0:10:39,0:10:50,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58," yeah that that's very flexible like how we would like to you know, force them into the breakout rooms and you know, make them busy and start it's really up to you, but the tutorial."
0:10:51,0:11:03,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58," is very straightforward like in terms of the system, most people are using so that we are going to practice that right now, how will we go actually through a couple of."
0:11:06,0:11:08,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,tactics will say to do it.
0:11:10,0:11:13,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58," So, how would you like to start."
0:11:14,0:11:18,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,If yeah so the plan is to first.
0:11:19,0:11:24,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58," Practice everybody, be able to create their own breakout rooms."
0:11:26,0:11:26,,So.
0:11:28,0:11:41,0b2e580e-b701-42a7-a355-253910aa8871,Can I follow up on Peters question real quick to that because if the if the project time slot is before the actual tutorials we have that three hour period designated towards walking them through kind of developing ideas.
0:11:42,0:11:59,0b2e580e-b701-42a7-a355-253910aa8871," Are are they expected to have some prior knowledge of what like ideas to come up with or how do we kind of like do we just have to present to them, I guess, on some of those ideas, because they seem to be at a disadvantage to not having any of the tutorial stuff before the project."
0:12:03,0:12:12,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,So so on the first day I don't think there is project meeting is there that does it start from for it doesn't start from first day right so.
0:12:13,0:12:15,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,The project meeting starts from second day.
0:12:17,0:12:18,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,So I think.
0:12:19,0:12:23,0b2e580e-b701-42a7-a355-253910aa8871," Okay, so we're just we're just skipping project first day and then second day that's one."
0:12:23,0:12:28,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58," yeah so so you won't start directly project, you will start with the first day and then."
0:12:29,0:12:41,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58," yeah and the first day is very helpful for the project selection, because I mean Connor was talking about types of model and what kind of questions to ask and stuff so it's very useful."
0:12:42,0:12:46,0b2e580e-b701-42a7-a355-253910aa8871,erdrich Thank you so So the first day actually second day.
0:12:46,0:13:04,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58," meeting for the project is very important as a ta because that's the most common distribution probably will make because afterwards they will be mostly working with the project, yes, other than like very high level guidance, that they will be."
0:13:06,0:13:07,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58," Asked from you, I guess."
0:13:09,0:13:11,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,yeah but who is the host right now.
0:13:16,0:13:19,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,But I don't seem no I don't.
0:13:20,0:13:21,fa3e5f86-2b2d-49aa-a214-9a84ff89e3bb,need to claim host.
0:13:23,0:13:24,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58," Okay, from."
0:13:26,0:13:28,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,That me.
0:13:28,0:13:29,fc07718b-853d-4a8f-8fd8-3c08aa713ede,How do we tell her host.
0:13:30,0:13:32,fa3e5f86-2b2d-49aa-a214-9a84ff89e3bb,you'll you'll see like extra controls.
0:13:32,0:13:34,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,yeah do you see like the breakout.
0:13:34,0:13:35,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,options the.
0:13:37,0:13:39,fa3e5f86-2b2d-49aa-a214-9a84ff89e3bb,thing I think currently no one's folks.
0:13:39,0:13:46,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58," Oh, I see the problem you can not login with my zoom account that's the first mistake."
0:13:47,0:14:02,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,mistake is that you're supposed to enter like login to zoom with your normal account so that once you enter you're the host actually so I gotta leave and come back because i'm just like you there's no host.
0:14:03,0:14:10,687cf1e0-ac67-4506-830c-47ea2cb14d8b," All right, yes, you can claim host now right now, but using the password in the email sent to us."
0:14:12,0:14:12,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,yeah.
0:14:12,0:14:13,fa3e5f86-2b2d-49aa-a214-9a84ff89e3bb,use the same.
0:14:14,0:14:14,687cf1e0-ac67-4506-830c-47ea2cb14d8b,yeah.
0:14:15,0:14:16,,It wasn't that hard.
0:14:17,0:14:24,a1958a61-a8ce-4002-9980-c66db01f95fe,If you open up the participants tab there's like a button at the bottom that says claim host man.
0:14:24,0:14:25,fa3e5f86-2b2d-49aa-a214-9a84ff89e3bb,You gotta click.
0:14:25,0:14:27,fa3e5f86-2b2d-49aa-a214-9a84ff89e3bb,click click the dots and then click.
0:14:29,0:14:31,a1958a61-a8ce-4002-9980-c66db01f95fe,yeah that's interesting.
0:14:31,0:14:33,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,I don't seem to be able to.
0:14:35,0:14:41,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58," do so so under participants, on my own name, there should be dots."
0:14:41,0:14:45,fa3e5f86-2b2d-49aa-a214-9a84ff89e3bb," know at the at the bottom at the bottom, where it."
0:14:45,0:14:46,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,might be uh huh.
0:14:47,0:14:50,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,yeah no no feature So where is the key.
0:14:52,0:14:56,fa3e5f86-2b2d-49aa-a214-9a84ff89e3bb," So, in your email where they sent you your zoom link."
0:14:57,0:15:04,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,it's the same actually procedure like I did login in or entering.
0:15:07,0:15:11,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,Is it a permanent meeting ID or the permanent password or.
0:15:11,0:15:14,fa3e5f86-2b2d-49aa-a214-9a84ff89e3bb,Not it's a different number.
0:15:17,0:15:18,fc07718b-853d-4a8f-8fd8-3c08aa713ede,I think it's called plane posts and they.
0:15:18,0:15:20,fa3e5f86-2b2d-49aa-a214-9a84ff89e3bb,said yeah they just label students in China.
0:15:23,0:15:28,687cf1e0-ac67-4506-830c-47ea2cb14d8b,Maybe you can click on the sign into claim host maybe that works.
0:15:32,0:15:40,fa3e5f86-2b2d-49aa-a214-9a84ff89e3bb," So, once you click claim host key it'll ask you for this number right, and then you put in the they gave you a claim host key number it's a separate number."
0:15:41,0:15:44,fa3e5f86-2b2d-49aa-a214-9a84ff89e3bb,In in the thing where they can resume.
0:15:52,0:15:54,fc07718b-853d-4a8f-8fd8-3c08aa713ede,Or maybe just faster to walk into.
0:15:55,0:15:59,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58," yeah Okay, if I finally found it searching through my emails."
0:16:00,0:16:01,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,I got it.
0:16:02,0:16:06,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,So we should be able to do this every day right we don't need to log in with.
0:16:07,0:16:10,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,an automatic and we can each time claim host right.
0:16:12,0:16:12,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,cool.
0:16:13,0:16:15,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58," All right, alright so."
0:16:18,0:16:24,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,What we should be doing is practicing the breakout room so i'll just rotate around the host.
0:16:25,0:16:28,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58," So, each one can practice right."
0:16:29,0:16:45,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58," So, first let me do it, I have been practicing for one year since last year, so i'll create how many we are let's say yeah let's create three breakout rooms, we will be at least three people in one."
0:16:48,0:16:56,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58," So I first say assign automatically, but I can actually reorder."
0:17:00,0:17:07,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58," I created two okay let's just do two so after I opened, I think you will see."
0:17:08,0:17:09,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,notification.
0:17:11,0:17:11,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,That.
0:17:12,0:17:19,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58," says to go and join it will go join yours, so you can go and then."
0:17:21,0:17:24,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,i'll message you to like come back once the order.
0:17:58,0:18:04,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58," Nice nice so close all the rooms, a timer started."
0:18:05,0:18:07,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,Did you see that timer as well.
0:18:07,0:18:09,fa3e5f86-2b2d-49aa-a214-9a84ff89e3bb,yeah yeah cool.
0:18:09,0:18:11,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,So that's like a good way of.
0:18:12,0:18:15,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58," You know, forcing students to finish up."
0:18:17,0:18:23,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,So that they come back exactly on time after one minute okay so.
0:18:24,0:18:32,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,let's see if everybody can recreate like practice this so let's start with.

0:20:33,0:20:36,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58," At this time, maybe you can also."
0:20:37,0:20:41,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,Try to rearrange us after.
0:20:43,0:21:01,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58," We are automatically assigned because sometimes you want to actually play the God and arrange them after chance level, because you remember, they said, sometimes there are good programmers and you want to assign them equally distributed equally."
0:21:02,0:21:03,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,yeah.
0:21:59,0:22:01,fa3e5f86-2b2d-49aa-a214-9a84ff89e3bb,You guys see my broadcasted message.
0:22:02,0:22:03,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,Right.
0:22:04,0:22:08,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58," By the way, the recording doesn't happen in the breakout rooms right so that's a."
0:22:11,0:22:16,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58," Safe space, you can comfort the students, you know if they are feeling."
0:22:18,0:22:19,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,uncomfortable.
0:22:20,0:22:23,4541350f-a10b-4b53-892c-31b181194b68," I was a broadcast message, because I didn't see anything actually."
0:22:24,0:22:26,fa3e5f86-2b2d-49aa-a214-9a84ff89e3bb," I just said so, but."
0:22:27,0:22:32,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,I saw it on the top like not in the chats but like.
0:22:32,0:22:34,fa3e5f86-2b2d-49aa-a214-9a84ff89e3bb," If, like a banner."
0:22:35,0:22:45,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,yeah so so it looks like only the host can send a message to everyone else the when you're in breakout your chat will be private to that breakout you cannot.
0:22:46,0:22:57,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58," Even though it says to everyone, when you write only the students in your breakout room sees so it looks like they're kind of completely isolated in the breakout rooms."
0:22:59,0:23:00,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,Okay.
0:23:01,0:23:03,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,So anybody else wants to go.
0:23:09,0:23:10,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,cool.

0:23:18,0:23:20,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58," By a you said, your project yes."
0:23:21,0:23:25,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58," yeah Okay, that is, I guess you don't need practice with this do you."
0:23:26,0:23:27,18148f2b-482a-4de9-8b89-79b42bdeb88a," know, I was just curious to try."
0:23:53,0:23:53,18148f2b-482a-4de9-8b89-79b42bdeb88a,What.
0:23:55,0:23:55,18148f2b-482a-4de9-8b89-79b42bdeb88a,Did.
0:23:56,0:23:57,18148f2b-482a-4de9-8b89-79b42bdeb88a,You want to sign.
0:24:01,0:24:03,18148f2b-482a-4de9-8b89-79b42bdeb88a,Because he divided people in.
0:24:04,0:24:10,fa3e5f86-2b2d-49aa-a214-9a84ff89e3bb," yeah those are the those are the rooms, that I made so you need to like reset it."
0:24:12,0:24:14,fa3e5f86-2b2d-49aa-a214-9a84ff89e3bb," And then, like you can put somewhere."
0:24:15,0:24:16,18148f2b-482a-4de9-8b89-79b42bdeb88a,to sort of.
0:24:17,0:24:17,fa3e5f86-2b2d-49aa-a214-9a84ff89e3bb,make sense.
0:24:18,0:24:18,18148f2b-482a-4de9-8b89-79b42bdeb88a,yeah yeah.
0:24:18,0:24:19,,Thank you.
0:24:29,0:24:30,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,Okay okay.
0:24:33,0:24:48,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58," Okay, so so so like like let's rest illegal you got dizzy too much switching around so remember that yeah too much too too quick searching is also not."
0:24:48,0:25:11,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58," perfect and also, it will be better that if you create a breakout room I think personally it's better to keep with the same people throughout at least one session like when you start a session it's like one and a half hours like one or two hours, then."
0:25:13,0:25:21,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58," They will be switching back and forth between their breakout to the main, but it will be better that each time is not random."
0:25:22,0:25:27,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,Each time is better it's same with the initial assigned one.
0:25:29,0:25:37,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58," Because, if you are after every exercise if you are randomizing the people who you are saying it kind of."
0:25:38,0:25:52,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58," Too exhausting all right, you keep track of people and you don't even like premise pronounce their names and yeah it just becomes maybe after a while it gets easier, but the learning curve becomes I think harder."
0:25:53,0:26:06,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58," So maybe it's more tolerable after a while, where everybody else like got to know each other really well, but in the beginning it's better to kind of separate isolate them batch by branch."
0:26:08,0:26:16,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58," Then, what else huh so the main question is which is, I think kind of."
0:26:18,0:26:38,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,kind of subjective how you would like to go so let's discuss how would you actually use the breakout room I think they they weren't certain on the technique right there is this option that we'd like the students to go and do practice by themselves in a smaller group but.
0:26:40,0:26:45,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,kinda it's hard to decide when it's better to do and when it's not.
0:26:47,0:27:06,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58," So so i'll tell you my opinion is my opinions, not the certified guideline, so what i'm planning to do is, and then we can discuss whether we can improve this or you like to try another option, so what I think is that last year."
0:27:09,0:27:10,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,I.
0:27:12,0:27:18,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58," Like we afford each exercises, they were going to their own breakout room, but I was."
0:27:20,0:27:30,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58," There one, at a time like when I was assigning their breakout rooms, I was spending half of the time in one and the other half to the other."
0:27:33,0:27:39,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,But that to me didn't kind of work out very well and I guess for the students because.
0:27:40,0:27:45,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58," When I was there, they were expecting me to solve and."
0:27:47,0:27:52,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58," When I was not there, they were waiting me to join like it was a kind of a."
0:27:55,0:27:56,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,coin dependence independence.
0:27:57,0:28:09,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,That didn't seem to like also scale like if there's three it's not the undoable like too exhausting to switch between three rooms are if there are three rooms.
0:28:11,0:28:16,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,So this year I thought i'll give it a shot and try to.
0:28:19,0:28:34,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58," make them more independent in the breakout room but spend more time together for discussion, like for actually clarification and things that I might know they might not know or bringing all together, so I thought."
0:28:36,0:28:39,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,I start each section.
0:28:42,0:28:47,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58," We beat each other, and they would like turn off their cameras and."
0:28:48,0:29:05,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58," audio to go and watch and read that part right, so the learning part is happening independently and individually that's not that's not that's not what we can do anything about because we are not there to teach we are there to."
0:29:06,0:29:18,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58," facilitate the exercise their their practice time right so once they are learning, I think we should allow the creative safe space comfortable space, by asking them to go off camera."
0:29:19,0:29:26,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,And you can get they can take their break like they can relax they can start stretching while they're watching videos.
0:29:27,0:29:40,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58," So for the learning time I think it's better if they're comfortable they close their camera audio and then after they watched and read that section, and they are ready to."
0:29:42,0:29:46,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58," attempt the exercise, then I think that's a good time to."
0:29:48,0:29:52,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,Go to the breakout but before that I think our main.
0:29:54,0:30:01,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,contribution would be to answering and helping them clarify what they didn't understand up to that point.
0:30:02,0:30:12,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58," Right so so before they go to their breakout room, we say do have questions like is there any confusing part you want to discuss any contents and then, once they."
0:30:13,0:30:28,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,All got clarified about the content and they are ready to go they go attempt exercises in their breakouts individually by individually either batches and then.
0:30:30,0:30:46,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58," They will come back to you, instead of you would go back to them in this way they will feel that they have to go out and achieve and accomplish something and come back to you or with the rest of peers, to discuss what they."
0:30:47,0:30:58,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58," learned, or what they failed, and we should really encourage them to fail fast like we should say okay they're very tricky stuff there are a lot of traps in the exercises."
0:30:58,0:31:17,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58," Make sure to fail fast and not get stuck and then what we could do in that time we could just randomly go there and observe and if they got stuck we would just push them, so we will not be they will not be expecting us, but they will be actually."
0:31:18,0:31:34,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58," monitored by us random live without our interference if everything's goes smoothly, so if they are actually progressing and discussing I don't think we should interfere when they are attempting to exercises."
0:31:35,0:31:35,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,But.
0:31:36,0:31:40,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,What is expected of them in return is.
0:31:41,0:31:51,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58," There are some discussion questions or there are some think questions so they should do that also I think in the breakout and then, when they come back."
0:31:52,0:32:05,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58," We should ask one of their representatives to give their answer to that maybe final question or two that exercise so so, for example, if you created three breakout rooms."
0:32:06,0:32:07,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,After they come back.
0:32:08,0:32:15,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,Wine we say okay let's stop this exercise by 10 minutes 20 minutes let's be like.
0:32:17,0:32:20,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58," We can gauge that time over time, to see whether."
0:32:21,0:32:31,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58," Like what's the worst case scenario, we can assign that time according to worst case scenario, and then, once they bite, we can ask each representative of the Group."
0:32:33,0:32:49,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58," So what we could do I think is, we can ask the person who did not share screen to talk as a representative of that breakout to in order to encourage more."
0:32:50,0:32:52,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,interactivity between the students.
0:32:53,0:32:56,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,yeah and then we can share our.
0:32:57,0:33:07,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58," observed discussions, so this way like if you have two or three breakout rooms, you will have a lot of things to say and discuss together."
0:33:09,0:33:20,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58," yeah so that's my plan, I like to try it's it feels it's scalable like if there are a lot of students it's still manageable and."
0:33:23,0:33:30,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58," And yeah let's see So if you think it's a good idea, bad idea, alternative."
0:33:31,0:33:32,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,You go.
0:33:35,0:33:38,0b2e580e-b701-42a7-a355-253910aa8871,There will also have access to the answers right.
0:33:38,0:33:40,fa3e5f86-2b2d-49aa-a214-9a84ff89e3bb,yeah yeah.
0:33:43,0:34:03,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58," yeah I mean we will most expect misunderstanding is about the contact content, because, like the exercises answers are there, but the problem is that they cannot understand answers as well, so after they tried and failed hopefully fast, then we can clarify about the answers."
0:34:06,0:34:19,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58," If they couldn't achieve like I mean so they come back and say Okay, we couldn't do it, and then say that's Okay, I mean nobody usually does it, so we should be positive and then save up to which part, did you get."
0:34:20,0:34:29,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58," And what was the confusing part let's say let's see let's let's always pin the problem to the content, like."
0:34:30,0:34:43,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58," let's say always that this content these exercises cons are not perfect, they are too difficult sometimes they are not at the right level so let's not get stuck so you should always encourage them to."
0:34:45,0:34:48,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,To not feel bad skipping or failing.
0:34:49,0:34:56,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58," Because the contents are not for everyone, but I, like the levels are sometimes too hard too easy and."
0:34:57,0:35:07,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,Too much usually too much so it's just that's The goal is to get through to really get them all.
0:35:09,0:35:17,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58," But the The point is that, if everybody discusses where they stuck they actually learn."
0:35:18,0:35:26,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58," Something that they didn't know after we clarify why they got stuck so they explain that Okay, we got stuck at this line of code that."
0:35:27,0:35:37,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58," let's say we didn't know, we had to reshape it reshape this cancer, and then we discuss why you should have done it and that and because they made a mistake."
0:35:37,0:35:49,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58," And we immediately gave them feedback, they will remember, and they learned something they didn't get through everything in the exercise, but at least they made one mistake that."
0:35:51,0:35:58,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58," They will never forget, because they made that mistake, and they will be solidified."
0:35:59,0:36:02,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,For that experience I guess.
0:36:04,0:36:08,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,yeah so that's what I think what else.
0:36:10,0:36:17,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58," yeah I mean so about three days upcoming, we will have really good chance to practice this."
0:36:18,0:36:33,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58," So if you don't have any questions or like to discuss more you can start planning the next three days, I have a question yeah sure, but."
0:36:34,0:36:41,687cf1e0-ac67-4506-830c-47ea2cb14d8b,Is it possible for students to come back to the main zoom room and then go back to their breakout room.
0:36:42,0:36:43,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,I think so.
0:36:44,0:36:45,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,We can try that again.
0:36:47,0:36:47,687cf1e0-ac67-4506-830c-47ea2cb14d8b,yeah.
0:36:48,0:36:48,687cf1e0-ac67-4506-830c-47ea2cb14d8b,we'd be nice.
0:36:49,0:36:50,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,If I could channel because.
0:36:50,0:36:54,687cf1e0-ac67-4506-830c-47ea2cb14d8b,Then I can explain them if they don't they cannot do it.
0:36:55,0:36:59,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58," Right What, for example, if they get dropped, I think."
0:36:59,0:37:00,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,From zoom.
0:37:01,0:37:04,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,wants to enter I think they first enter to the main room.
0:37:06,0:37:09,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58," Then they will be able to join, to the breakout."
0:37:11,0:37:15,fc07718b-853d-4a8f-8fd8-3c08aa713ede,stairway for them to request for the ta to show up there.
0:37:15,0:37:23,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,yeah yeah I think there is a raise hand or something yeah let's try that so who wants to try next yeah sure Peter.
0:37:24,0:37:25,a1958a61-a8ce-4002-9980-c66db01f95fe,And john.
0:37:26,0:37:27,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,The who's the host.
0:37:28,0:37:31,687cf1e0-ac67-4506-830c-47ea2cb14d8b,has been smoking here to make sure that we try this.
0:37:32,0:37:33,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,yeah yeah.
0:38:16,0:38:17,fc07718b-853d-4a8f-8fd8-3c08aa713ede,yeah.
0:38:17,0:38:18,fc07718b-853d-4a8f-8fd8-3c08aa713ede,i'm back in the.
0:38:18,0:38:22,fc07718b-853d-4a8f-8fd8-3c08aa713ede,main room yeah I can see breakout rooms button at the bottom of that I can jump.
0:38:22,0:38:23,a1958a61-a8ce-4002-9980-c66db01f95fe,Okay cool.
0:38:40,0:38:45,a1958a61-a8ce-4002-9980-c66db01f95fe," Okay, so what happens when someone requests."
0:38:45,0:38:58,a1958a61-a8ce-4002-9980-c66db01f95fe," Like help is there's a dialogue button that opens that says so, and so in Room one room to as requested that usually and then there's a button to join their breakout room."
0:39:00,0:39:06,a1958a61-a8ce-4002-9980-c66db01f95fe," And also Eric tried, as a studio even leave the breakout room and then rejoin."
0:39:08,0:39:10,a1958a61-a8ce-4002-9980-c66db01f95fe,The main room and then go back into the gap.
0:39:10,0:39:16,fc07718b-853d-4a8f-8fd8-3c08aa713ede," When you leave it you see the breakout room button at the bottom bar after and then, if you press that able to save rejoin."
0:39:21,0:39:23,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58," Well, by the way, another thing I remember."
0:39:25,0:39:34,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58," So so as a monitoring person I thought, if you leave our video off and join it will be less distracting."
0:39:36,0:39:43,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58," yeah, otherwise we will be terrifying his new show like duties of a sudden, he shows up during the exercise."
0:39:45,0:39:45,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,yeah.
0:39:48,0:39:50,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,So what.
0:39:50,0:39:53,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,else my interaction so so.
0:39:53,0:40:07,fc07718b-853d-4a8f-8fd8-3c08aa713ede," i'm actually like it's hard to time these things and students may not have time to finish the exercises if that's the case when we're all together, should we like discuss those parts that that weren't finished and maybe explain like like as a group, explain the solutions."
0:40:10,0:40:18,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58," Right so after they come back from the breakout room like we will discuss their problems right, so their problems and also like."
0:40:19,0:40:28,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,If they could come up with a solution to one of the things questions like one of the discussion questions so but usually like first we start with their problems.
0:40:30,0:40:36,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,And yeah it's just about the time like how much time allows we can get to the.
0:40:36,0:40:38,,bottom of their problems.
0:40:40,0:40:48,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58," But yeah mainly timing is the arm, a responsibility to make sure we allow enough time for each step."
0:40:51,0:40:59,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58," yeah so, so I think being just strict about how much they spend time on the exercise is enough to."
0:41:00,0:41:02,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,allow time for the rest.
0:41:04,0:41:15,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58," yeah but it's practice like you might think this is a very easy exercise that takes requires very little time, but for main other students, it might be much."
0:41:17,0:41:23,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58," more difficult so over time, you will get to realize how much they like to spend on the exercise."
0:41:25,0:41:28,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58," Or how much do you think it's better for them, you can ask them, you can ask them."
0:41:29,0:41:47,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58," Did you get bored did you do you want to spend more time on it like for the next time for the next time to recalibrate on their interest on spending more time like like there's a threshold, you know if you fail too many times too fast, you don't want to fail anymore so."
0:41:48,0:41:56,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58," yeah, for example, if some exercises are really long and they just already failed too many times at some steps."
0:41:58,0:42:09,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,For I think for the motivational for the spirit it's better to skip that exercise entirely because sometimes it happens that the content is written so badly.
0:42:11,0:42:23,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58," That they just made it so difficult that just getting through, it is impossible and it's really important that we spot this and prevent them to drain themselves in that."
0:42:25,0:42:27,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58," I know this because, like i'm a content creator."
0:42:28,0:42:32,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58," And i've reviewed so many bad contents, also in pre parts and."
0:42:33,0:42:42,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58," yeah it's just this never blame the students it's always the content, I mean this year's gonna be probably a lot better but, for example on the deep learning."
0:42:43,0:42:47,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58," it's going to be again, like last year, a lot of difficulties."
0:42:48,0:42:50,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,So so keeping their spirit.
0:42:51,0:42:54,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,Active is very important yeah.
0:42:57,0:43:00,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58," So so For that reason, I felt like."
0:43:02,0:43:20,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,You should be more concerned I think about time and morale of the students and their progress rather than you exhausting yourself doing the exercises with them or teaching too much or.
0:43:22,0:43:29,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58," yeah so so you shouldn't exhaust yourself, because if you're exhausted they're all going to be all exhausted because."
0:43:30,0:43:43,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58," They feel demotivated if the ta is exhausted, so you should always you know feel keep your attitude positive so that they feel that."
0:43:45,0:44:06,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58," They can count on you, if because, like I did this last year I was overly into teaching and trying and learning everything together with them that I felt like i'm becoming the moderator towards the end that I cannot keep them up as well."
0:44:07,0:44:17,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,So yeah spending time beforehand reviewing and maybe doing some exercises would really help you be able to relax and.
0:44:19,0:44:33,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58," And yeah I mean, and if you don't attempt the exercises it wouldn't really be the end of the world for the students, I mean you might be losing in your learning experience, but for the students."
0:44:34,0:44:57,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58," If you actually don't attempt to make all those mistakes and just you know read from the solution it wouldn't be so bad for the students, I think, because it will not exhaust you and you will still be able to debug there you can still teach them about their mistakes, I mean."
0:44:59,0:45:03,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58," yeah because at the end of day, it is not very good to do with them."
0:45:06,0:45:09,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,Because yeah they they will rely on you too much that.
0:45:12,0:45:13,,yeah.
0:45:14,0:45:15,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,So.
0:45:19,0:45:21,fa3e5f86-2b2d-49aa-a214-9a84ff89e3bb,We figure out the schedule.
0:45:21,0:45:24,fa3e5f86-2b2d-49aa-a214-9a84ff89e3bb,For tomorrow yeah so if we're going to split this into.
0:45:26,0:45:31,fa3e5f86-2b2d-49aa-a214-9a84ff89e3bb," into like two hours each, then you was doing when my."
0:45:32,0:45:32,,Right.
0:45:33,0:45:35,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58," So, how would you like to."
0:45:37,0:45:41,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,planet should create like a Google Doc or something.
0:45:41,0:45:42,fa3e5f86-2b2d-49aa-a214-9a84ff89e3bb,Because like yes.
0:45:42,0:45:52,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58," areas, I guess, to consider like the content, like how familiar and how billing Lee you want to teach it and then the availability."
0:45:53,0:45:56,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,And I guess what's the third criteria.
0:45:59,0:46:01,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,How easy it is I guess.
0:46:02,0:46:03,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,or yeah.
0:46:05,0:46:06,,So.
0:46:07,0:46:20,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58," I mean, I will pick the last one, to allow you more flexibility so let's create a Google Doc for you."
0:46:22,0:46:26,fa3e5f86-2b2d-49aa-a214-9a84ff89e3bb,yeah i'm also good with any of them have no preference.
0:46:27,0:46:28,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,Okay um.
0:46:30,0:46:39,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58," Then, maybe, maybe we can start with just going one by one from the most priority students who have like time availability issues."
0:46:41,0:46:53,a1958a61-a8ce-4002-9980-c66db01f95fe," I like to do one of the Friday ones, because because that was supposed to be a holiday for me anyway so there's like nothing going on in my lab that day so it's it's better for by if I take off."
0:46:55,0:46:55,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,Okay sure.
0:46:56,0:46:57,0b2e580e-b701-42a7-a355-253910aa8871,So I won't be.
0:46:57,0:47:04,0b2e580e-b701-42a7-a355-253910aa8871," I won't be around on Friday actually so that works perfectly i'm, I would like to kind of do a majority tomorrow."
0:47:05,0:47:13,0b2e580e-b701-42a7-a355-253910aa8871," Because i'm also not as familiar with calculus, but I can support on tomorrow and the following day, but majority tomorrow."
0:47:16,0:47:19,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,cool anyone else in terms of time priority.
0:47:21,0:47:27,fa3e5f86-2b2d-49aa-a214-9a84ff89e3bb,I have not heard anything from my students about it so i'm i'm good any time.
0:47:28,0:47:31,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58," No, no, not the students, like you, as a."
0:47:32,0:47:34,fa3e5f86-2b2d-49aa-a214-9a84ff89e3bb," yeah no, I have no."
0:47:35,0:47:41,29ed6943-18c9-4b1d-ab32-b1a83df77d84," Okay, my turn I do tomorrow, since i'm moving into a different House tomorrow so."
0:47:42,0:47:44,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58," Not only tomorrow, but the other days."
0:47:44,0:47:45,,yeah.
0:47:47,0:47:53,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58," Okay, so it looks like time wants be main issue, so, then we can just mainly pitch based on content."
0:47:55,0:47:59,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,Let me share the documents I created just.
0:48:02,0:48:03,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,Just a Google Doc.
0:48:05,0:48:08,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,i'll just fill it very fast day one.
0:48:14,0:48:19,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,So the day one is linear algebra I don't remember Do you remember.
0:48:19,0:48:31,fa3e5f86-2b2d-49aa-a214-9a84ff89e3bb,yeah they want linear algebra it to calculus and and day three and statistics and so then within each like day they're different tutorials.
0:48:34,0:48:39,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,Are the different like the first half is it very different than second half.
0:48:39,0:48:42,fa3e5f86-2b2d-49aa-a214-9a84ff89e3bb,know I think they they just like they're different topics within.
0:48:43,0:48:44,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,Okay.
0:48:45,0:48:46,687cf1e0-ac67-4506-830c-47ea2cb14d8b,Sorry.
0:48:46,0:48:50,fa3e5f86-2b2d-49aa-a214-9a84ff89e3bb,mess up so like linear algebra tutorial one inspectors tutorial tues matrices.
0:48:51,0:48:56,29ed6943-18c9-4b1d-ab32-b1a83df77d84," We want to break it up by tutorial like each of us can take one tutorial per day, like, I can do that."
0:48:58,0:48:59,fa3e5f86-2b2d-49aa-a214-9a84ff89e3bb,Probably makes the most sense.
0:48:59,0:49:02,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,yeah I don't want it to for.
0:49:02,0:49:04,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58," Like to one, the first half."
0:49:05,0:49:09,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,And then they have one hour break and then they start to.
0:49:10,0:49:11,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,obey it.
0:49:11,0:49:11,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,I think.
0:49:11,0:49:12,687cf1e0-ac67-4506-830c-47ea2cb14d8b,Are you are.
0:49:13,0:49:20,687cf1e0-ac67-4506-830c-47ea2cb14d8b," Many other phones for this room, because I know your part, and yes, if."
0:49:20,0:49:21,4541350f-a10b-4b53-892c-31b181194b68,there.
0:49:21,0:49:22,687cf1e0-ac67-4506-830c-47ea2cb14d8b,Are other things I can.
0:49:22,0:49:28,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58," All right, sure sure feel free to leave anytime or, if you have any question, we can first."
0:49:29,0:49:30,687cf1e0-ac67-4506-830c-47ea2cb14d8b,Oh i'm fine.
0:49:32,0:49:36,4541350f-a10b-4b53-892c-31b181194b68,We going to do a hands on any tutorial actually I thought this was.
0:49:36,0:49:37,fa3e5f86-2b2d-49aa-a214-9a84ff89e3bb,Part of the.
0:49:37,0:49:37,4541350f-a10b-4b53-892c-31b181194b68,Training today.
0:49:38,0:49:39,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,I know.
0:49:39,0:49:39,,I have.
0:49:41,0:49:43,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,To actually go through one of the exercises.
0:49:44,0:49:48,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58," Okay, we could try yeah sure i'm."
0:49:49,0:49:53,4541350f-a10b-4b53-892c-31b181194b68,Just asking i'm not sure if it was part of of the of the training.
0:49:54,0:49:56,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,yeah me too actually but.
0:49:56,0:50:02,4541350f-a10b-4b53-892c-31b181194b68,Because actually I see the slides now and it seemed that we're supposed to say something like that i'm not very sure.
0:50:03,0:50:06,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,Oh yeah I think we should practice peer programming like.
0:50:06,0:50:07,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,not particularly that.
0:50:08,0:50:12,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58," said spot some exercise, we will."
0:50:13,0:50:15,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,yeah they want us to do an exercise.
0:50:15,0:50:19,fa3e5f86-2b2d-49aa-a214-9a84ff89e3bb," You want us to do a week, one day, five which is."
0:50:19,0:50:22,fa3e5f86-2b2d-49aa-a214-9a84ff89e3bb," Okay, so much action ality reduction."
0:50:26,0:50:27,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,it's week one.
0:50:28,0:50:29,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,Day.
0:50:30,0:50:31,,five.
0:50:35,0:50:41,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58," Okay, so does that mean i'm the ta your students, so you will you'll actually go to as a student."
0:50:44,0:50:50,fa3e5f86-2b2d-49aa-a214-9a84ff89e3bb,yeah I guess so so yeah so yeah it says that you're supposed to put us in breakout rooms and then.
0:50:52,0:50:53,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,Okay.
0:50:54,0:50:55,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58," Alright, so."
0:50:57,0:51:03,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,Do you want to do it in groups of three yeah like in three breakout rooms all right so.
0:51:05,0:51:07,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58," So, so how about we actually go through."
0:51:08,0:51:19,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58," The whole section, as we discussed like first read and then discuss if you have any problems with content and then go to the exercise, not just directly go."
0:51:20,0:51:22,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,So let me also bring my.
0:51:23,0:51:25,687cf1e0-ac67-4506-830c-47ea2cb14d8b,own please share the link.

0:51:35,0:51:36,a1958a61-a8ce-4002-9980-c66db01f95fe,Is it just the first tutorial.
0:51:37,0:51:42,fa3e5f86-2b2d-49aa-a214-9a84ff89e3bb," it's it's week, one day, five, so I don't think it's the first tutorial."
0:51:42,0:51:44,a1958a61-a8ce-4002-9980-c66db01f95fe,But like first tutorial on day five.
0:51:44,0:51:45,fa3e5f86-2b2d-49aa-a214-9a84ff89e3bb,yeah.
0:51:45,0:51:46,a1958a61-a8ce-4002-9980-c66db01f95fe,Oh yeah okay.

0:51:52,0:51:56,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,They want us to jump into another section in the PCA.
0:51:59,0:52:02,fc07718b-853d-4a8f-8fd8-3c08aa713ede,know just said geometric view of data tutorial.
0:52:13,0:52:17,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58," i'm not sure if i'm in the right place, let them share screen."
0:52:19,0:52:21,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58," So is it, this one."
0:52:24,0:52:25,fa3e5f86-2b2d-49aa-a214-9a84ff89e3bb,Yes.
0:52:25,0:52:25,,So.
0:52:26,0:52:29,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,The first exercise.
0:52:33,0:52:34,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,Is that right.
0:52:35,0:52:36,fa3e5f86-2b2d-49aa-a214-9a84ff89e3bb,yeah I mean.
0:52:40,0:52:43,fa3e5f86-2b2d-49aa-a214-9a84ff89e3bb,Okay yeah it says yeah we finished the first exercise.
0:52:45,0:52:46,4541350f-a10b-4b53-892c-31b181194b68,Can I ask something before.
0:52:46,0:52:47,,You.
0:52:48,0:52:53,4541350f-a10b-4b53-892c-31b181194b68," At some point, I think i've read that we should make a copy of the other collab document."
0:52:54,0:53:00,4541350f-a10b-4b53-892c-31b181194b68," In order not to edit directly So yes, something that we do and we shared with the students or how does it work exactly."
0:53:01,0:53:05,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58," I mean usually everybody should do it because, like."
0:53:06,0:53:08,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,The changes will not be saved it's not necessary.
0:53:10,0:53:14,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,But if you want your progress to be saved.
0:53:15,0:53:19,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,You can you can make a copy of it in your drive.
0:53:21,0:53:34,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58," And then, whatever you do in here, it will be saved in your drive as well, but it's not necessary at all like people can keep working on this temporary version as well."
0:53:37,0:53:38,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,yeah.
0:53:41,0:53:49,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58," Okay, so so there they go would be jealous maybe a fast forward the process."
0:53:50,0:53:57,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,So we will watch the video with our videos of right and then read through the content.
0:53:59,0:54:12,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58," And then, like just before the exercise finishes return our videos on and usually we can start when everybody's videos on."
0:54:14,0:54:16,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,So this way like we don't pressure people.
0:54:18,0:54:26,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58," So that if people, some people some students have some emergency they had to take a longer break or something."
0:54:27,0:54:32,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58," It would be nice if they let you know in advance, but if, for some reason they got left behind."
0:54:33,0:54:42,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58," that's the time to like get synced with everybody, but if, for example, if one person is remains and their video is not on, and like after."
0:54:43,0:55:02,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58," Like 30 seconds you waited and then you can you know talk and say like are you there is everything's fine can we help and stuff and like if they really didn't respond, then you can continue like there's a chance that they got dropped, or they just left computer or something happens."
0:55:03,0:55:18,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58," yeah but usually people like come back very quickly and if, after 30 seconds, nobody the last person didn't show up is mostly an emergency it's, not because they are still reading you're."
0:55:20,0:55:23,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,engaged yeah they're probably disengage so you can continue after.
0:55:25,0:55:32,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58," So then, after they learned about the topic and watch them read, then we will."
0:55:33,0:55:38,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,create the breakout room to go and read exercise and then attempt it together.
0:55:39,0:55:43,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58," So let's imagine we know this parts, we learned."
0:55:45,0:55:55,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,So you had questions you had confusions you share and we discussed sometimes you might not probably know the answer to.
0:55:56,0:56:09,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58," Then, in that case you can say that Okay, in the meantime you're gonna attempt exercise i'll go and ask the content team in the discord and then you can try to find answers for them."
0:56:10,0:56:24,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58," yeah but but don't get stuck yourself as well, if you like, don't know answers like shy don't be shy to say like I don't know as well as my first time reading this and it's also confusing right also you can blame the company can say it's just confusing."
0:56:26,0:56:40,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,So yeah so let's say you are ready to start the exercise and i'll create the breakout rooms and then i'll just you know mysteriously with my videos have come and monitor you.
0:56:41,0:56:41,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,Okay.
0:56:42,0:56:46,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58," So, creating the breakout room."
0:56:48,0:56:50,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,Minor question also does anyone see that.
0:56:50,0:56:55,fc07718b-853d-4a8f-8fd8-3c08aa713ede,Time that the tutorial supposed to take that the extra sad are supposed to take that they mentioned.
0:56:56,0:57:07,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58," Apparently, that feature doesn't exist for all content so some tutorials have that some Downs because, like some creatures included some didn't."
0:57:08,0:57:20,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58," But yeah I mean don't, even if it exists don't trust it too much your instincts and and the current progress and how much time left, and how much time you feel is better spent."
0:57:21,0:57:28,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58," progressing farther it's really up to you because, like it's very dynamic like if something happened they got really stuck in the beginning."
0:57:29,0:57:42,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58," It will be better if you like, kind of speed up and try to get to the end rather than spend that estimated time because you already are behind, and it will be better if you try to catch up."
0:57:44,0:57:50,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,yeah so i'll create three breakout room I assign some people.
0:57:51,0:57:52,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,i'll try to.
0:57:54,0:57:54,,Like.
0:57:56,0:58:04,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58," switch some people around so it becomes kinda even I don't know I don't know use I don't have any idea, but I just practice."
0:58:07,0:58:07,fa3e5f86-2b2d-49aa-a214-9a84ff89e3bb,So.
0:58:08,0:58:09,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,yeah created.
0:58:09,0:58:12,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,And i'll see.
1:04:22,1:04:23,fa3e5f86-2b2d-49aa-a214-9a84ff89e3bb,alright.
1:04:24,1:04:27,fa3e5f86-2b2d-49aa-a214-9a84ff89e3bb,looks like looks like others are still working on it.
1:04:28,1:04:29,0b2e580e-b701-42a7-a355-253910aa8871,Just two quick.
1:04:32,1:04:34,fa3e5f86-2b2d-49aa-a214-9a84ff89e3bb,skipped the whole tutorial because they've.
1:04:36,1:04:38,fa3e5f86-2b2d-49aa-a214-9a84ff89e3bb,I think I think this is like.
1:04:40,1:04:46,fa3e5f86-2b2d-49aa-a214-9a84ff89e3bb,Things like pretty much what you did for like when you had to submit the video to apply.
1:04:48,1:04:49,fa3e5f86-2b2d-49aa-a214-9a84ff89e3bb,I know it's going to be like two lines.
1:05:05,1:05:08,fa3e5f86-2b2d-49aa-a214-9a84ff89e3bb,Okay let's see alright so once we're done we did the pure programming.
1:05:11,1:05:15,fa3e5f86-2b2d-49aa-a214-9a84ff89e3bb," Oh alright, I guess you guys are supposed to do the other two exercises."
1:05:17,1:05:18,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58," Right, so how."
1:05:20,1:05:21,fa3e5f86-2b2d-49aa-a214-9a84ff89e3bb,Are we did exercise one.
1:05:24,1:05:26,fa3e5f86-2b2d-49aa-a214-9a84ff89e3bb,yeah just getting used to allowance.
1:05:27,1:05:29,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,yeah I saw you did pretty fast.
1:05:31,1:05:34,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,The others kinda got started.
1:05:36,1:05:39,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58," Okay, so let me give the timers."
1:05:46,1:05:48,fa3e5f86-2b2d-49aa-a214-9a84ff89e3bb,minute left yeah.
1:05:48,1:05:52,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,it's this part that part they get really excited I guess.
1:05:56,1:05:57,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58," All right, so."
1:05:59,1:06:05,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58," I did go, I will back on, I think we are still waiting for others."
1:06:07,1:06:08,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,yeah it's.
1:06:09,1:06:11,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,Important to wait for the one minute.
1:06:12,1:06:18,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58," This is the time, usually they try to rush and figure out everything."
1:06:19,1:06:20,0b2e580e-b701-42a7-a355-253910aa8871,I have a question in meantime.
1:06:21,1:06:38,0b2e580e-b701-42a7-a355-253910aa8871," day one, and day two are we supposed to be fairly familiar with the actual data set so that if students become stuck and try to figuring out how or what they want to model we can provide suggestions and glowing angling them towards one of the four data sets that will be provided."
1:06:39,1:06:40,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58," I think, no."
1:06:41,1:06:46,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,No yeah I think they should just focus on the questions like not the data set.
1:06:47,1:06:55,fa3e5f86-2b2d-49aa-a214-9a84ff89e3bb,I think day to when they're trying to figure out project not not for the pre REC day to have like week one so next week.
1:06:56,1:06:56,,Right.
1:06:57,1:07:00,fa3e5f86-2b2d-49aa-a214-9a84ff89e3bb,yeah that's when for us and slot for they're going to be.
1:07:02,1:07:05,fa3e5f86-2b2d-49aa-a214-9a84ff89e3bb,figuring out the what they want to work on the brainstorming at least.
1:07:07,1:07:09,0b2e580e-b701-42a7-a355-253910aa8871,yeah so i'm saying like they don't have ideas.
1:07:10,1:07:18,fa3e5f86-2b2d-49aa-a214-9a84ff89e3bb,or like yeah I mean I think yeah I think we should just tell them like hey look here's some data sets and then let them brainstorm.
1:07:19,1:07:19,0b2e580e-b701-42a7-a355-253910aa8871,Right now.
1:07:22,1:07:23,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,But I think.
1:07:23,1:07:33,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,The goal of the first day and also second day is not to bias them be the data set but try to make them think of a question.
1:07:34,1:07:42,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58," Like hypothesis, so they should come up with their own hypothesis, and then after they gave us their hypothesis, then we can tell okay go use the status."
1:07:45,1:07:55,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,So I guess that's what i'm trying to teach like this very the whole emphasis of day two is not to be.
1:07:57,1:08:00,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,biased with techniques or data.
1:08:01,1:08:25,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,or like you know publication like should just you know start a project for just getting a lot of citations or just for using a method or just trying to analyze the data sets so so they're trying to focus so much on a phenomenon to to to find an interesting phenomena and then.
1:08:27,1:08:42,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58," find an interesting hypothesis that can be solved so that part you help to define whether it's doable to solve that hypothesis or not, and you tell them yeah you can read this dataset, for example."
1:08:43,1:08:47,fa3e5f86-2b2d-49aa-a214-9a84ff89e3bb,I see so you're saying we start them you start them very general.
1:08:48,1:08:52,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,yeah we started with like just going to nature observe.
1:08:53,1:08:53,,what's interesting.
1:08:56,1:09:04,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58," And then, like try to formalize it a bit mathematically and come up with like a null hypothesis is that mystical hypothesis."
1:09:06,1:09:16,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58," Yes, so ideally they don't need to know any background to be a scientist right they just need to come up with a hypothesis which doesn't need to be that."
1:09:18,1:09:30,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58," Formal in the beginning doesn't have to be so mathematical but, but you can help a lot into saying this is good, this is bad as good as that but, but they should ideally be generating their hypothesis."
1:09:31,1:09:31,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,There are.
1:09:32,1:09:42,a1958a61-a8ce-4002-9980-c66db01f95fe," Others i've had a few different students, say, specifically that they want to work with this, they want to learn how to work with this type of data or that."
1:09:44,1:09:45,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,yeah I mean many centers are biased.
1:09:46,1:09:51,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,towards their research because they're not beginners they already started.
1:09:52,1:09:56,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,Projects so they they're usually looking for help in that direction.
1:09:57,1:09:59,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58," But, but still like as a."
1:10:00,1:10:11,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58," As a pedagogical approach we should force them to think, as if you're going to start fresh as a New Scientist forget about like what you're doing."
1:10:11,1:10:21,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58," But, of course, like that's not realistic, they still gonna look for phenomenons that people have already been studied with that data set or retired approach."
1:10:22,1:10:40,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58," But yeah I mean to be fair to new beginners because, like not everybody have their own projects and not everybody's neuroscientist and not everybody has ideas or biases two different approaches so it's better to force everybody to be."
1:10:42,1:10:45,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,Fresh you know to start fresh tab open mind.
1:10:47,1:10:48,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,yeah.
1:10:50,1:10:54,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58," What else haha Okay, so I observed."
1:10:55,1:11:02,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,That while you were doing the exercises I realized you actually need time to meet exercises.
1:11:02,1:11:03,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,alone.
1:11:03,1:11:05,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,that's that's seems to be.
1:11:06,1:11:07,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,kind of.
1:11:09,1:11:22,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58," learning process or requires some time to digest the question at least before starting to attempt, so I guess it's better to include the."
1:11:24,1:11:38,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58," text after exercise as part of the off time so that students when they are ready to share their screen they actually know what they're going to try to solve but, but they should not be."
1:11:38,1:11:46,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58," Trying to solve it by themselves, they should be just think about that question that they read as the."
1:11:46,1:11:47,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,Before the code.
1:11:48,1:11:51,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,So they should read whatever is before the code I think it's better.
1:11:52,1:12:05,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58," So that once they share screen, they all know the problem they don't need to discuss the problem because discussing the problem is also hard and it's better if it's done with you as a ta."
1:12:07,1:12:11,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,yeah so so it will be a lot faster if they do pair programming.
1:12:13,1:12:15,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,Immediately after they read everything.
1:12:18,1:12:29,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58," yeah but they still need to come up with their own discussions of the outputs that like you should encourage them to discuss many things after either they finished or not, so if they didn't finish."
1:12:30,1:12:39,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58," Then they should be discussing why this was difficult why they got chopped why the content is so bad, for you know they should discuss why they fail."
1:12:39,1:12:52,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58," But if they succeeded, they should still try to discuss their outputs like whether they can interpret output like okay that they've managed to get the required steps."
1:12:55,1:12:57,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,Whether they actually understood the output.
1:12:58,1:13:17,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58," or whether they can understand the rest of the codes because usually the exercise steps are just 10% off to understand if if you can just do the step it doesn't mean that you got everything so for each exercise, they can spend so much time like there is never."
1:13:18,1:13:20,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,Enough time in a.
1:13:21,1:13:40,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58," tutorial to go through all the details of a given exercise, but they should be not focusing on the Court mainly if they finish those steps they should be mainly focusing on interpreting the output and after interpreting the output, then, if there is any questions."
1:13:41,1:13:44,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58," or any discussions, they should be also doing that themselves."
1:13:46,1:13:50,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,yeah so so you should encourage them to not leave their.
1:13:51,1:13:59,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,breakout room until you ask them to that like they should spend all the time that you give.
1:14:00,1:14:18,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58," They did they should, I think okay job because I just wrote this one line of code and the output was correct, you know it's done right I should not be thinking about this anymore, so it should encourage them that there's no going back here is, I mean they can, if they decide to rest."
1:14:19,1:14:27,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58," If there is no curiosity they're left, they can just you know stay there that rest, but I think it's not."
1:14:28,1:14:29,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,So effective to.
1:14:30,1:14:37,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58," Come back to the main room too early, because also when they come back, they want to immediately discuss with the ta but."
1:14:38,1:14:50,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58," That discussion will be a private discussion that will not be shared with everyone else, so maybe you will be exhausted, and you repeat yourself so it's better that they start discussing altogether."
1:14:52,1:15:00,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,yeah that's some of my observations from this new approach I just made up.
1:15:01,1:15:04,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58," yeah hopefully works better, this time."
1:15:05,1:15:05,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,yeah.
1:15:07,1:15:08,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,So any.
1:15:11,1:15:11,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,question.
1:15:18,1:15:21,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58," All right, so then let's go the."
1:15:22,1:15:25,fa3e5f86-2b2d-49aa-a214-9a84ff89e3bb,schedule yeah yeah let's make the schedule.
1:15:29,1:15:30,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,y'all have the link right.
1:15:34,1:15:41,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,What I noticed is that the number of tutorials probably not going to be too on the so.
1:15:41,1:15:42,fc07718b-853d-4a8f-8fd8-3c08aa713ede,calculus s3.
1:15:42,1:15:44,fa3e5f86-2b2d-49aa-a214-9a84ff89e3bb,The other yeah too.
1:15:44,1:15:45,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,Many around your House.
1:15:45,1:15:46,fc07718b-853d-4a8f-8fd8-3c08aa713ede,Has like a bonus one.
1:15:49,1:15:56,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58," So, then, we need to be a bit wiser into dividing so he's only calculus three yeah."
1:16:00,1:16:01,687cf1e0-ac67-4506-830c-47ea2cb14d8b,Leave so.
1:16:01,1:16:02,4541350f-a10b-4b53-892c-31b181194b68,yeah so.
1:16:02,1:16:03,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,yeah right sure.
1:16:03,1:16:05,4541350f-a10b-4b53-892c-31b181194b68," Okay, thanks, a lot."
1:16:09,1:16:12,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,Thank you alrighty Thank you.
1:16:15,1:16:18,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58," So so then how about this, we just."
1:16:20,1:16:28,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58," The go as much as we can, until the break right like you don't worry about this so it's just not to one or just session one."
1:16:33,1:16:36,0b2e580e-b701-42a7-a355-253910aa8871," I mean, are we going to have multiple people for per day multiple Th."
1:16:36,1:16:39,fa3e5f86-2b2d-49aa-a214-9a84ff89e3bb," yeah yeah that's what I was wondering, so if you're."
1:16:39,1:16:45,fa3e5f86-2b2d-49aa-a214-9a84ff89e3bb," Trying to split this up as much as possible, it will be kind of hard if we don't define where we're stopping."
1:16:46,1:16:47,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,Very are stopping.
1:16:49,1:16:49,fa3e5f86-2b2d-49aa-a214-9a84ff89e3bb,yeah.
1:16:51,1:16:55,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,So so there's a one hour break we know exactly when you're stopping.
1:16:56,1:16:58,fa3e5f86-2b2d-49aa-a214-9a84ff89e3bb,Right yeah in the content.
1:16:59,1:17:03,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58," So yes, not up to us right, I mean that's up to the students like how much."
1:17:05,1:17:06,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,You know.
1:17:06,1:17:10,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58," Like you, usually like they don't finish you know."
1:17:10,1:17:11,fa3e5f86-2b2d-49aa-a214-9a84ff89e3bb,I see.
1:17:12,1:17:12,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,I see.
1:17:12,1:17:14,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,Only finishes when.
1:17:15,1:17:18,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58," they're finished, which is usually not the end of the tutorials."
1:17:19,1:17:19,,As they only.
1:17:21,1:17:21,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,yeah.
1:17:23,1:17:29,fa3e5f86-2b2d-49aa-a214-9a84ff89e3bb," So, then, I guess you know, whoever whoever finishes a session, they just tell us where they left off, and then we."
1:17:29,1:17:30,,yeah.
1:17:33,1:17:37,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58," Okay, so who wants to go which."
1:17:38,1:17:40,fa3e5f86-2b2d-49aa-a214-9a84ff89e3bb,I cannot add it.
1:17:41,1:17:43,fc07718b-853d-4a8f-8fd8-3c08aa713ede,Should we start to add constraints.
1:17:45,1:17:49,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,Oh yeah it's view okay I just created edit access.
1:17:53,1:18:02,0b2e580e-b701-42a7-a355-253910aa8871," Are we doing multiple tiers per per day because we're going to have a decent amount of students right, we want to have a more than one are we just doing one per the entire session."
1:18:03,1:18:06,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,It will be one for all of our students.
1:18:08,1:18:12,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58," So we will use one link for all the students, but we will be."
1:18:14,1:18:15,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58," Doing one, at a time."
1:18:16,1:18:18,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,But all students will be always scatter.
1:18:21,1:18:26,fa3e5f86-2b2d-49aa-a214-9a84ff89e3bb,yeah so it's all it's only gonna be one person for session.
1:18:26,1:18:27,fa3e5f86-2b2d-49aa-a214-9a84ff89e3bb,And then I guess.
1:18:27,1:18:31,fa3e5f86-2b2d-49aa-a214-9a84ff89e3bb,If someone wants to get into multiple sessions each day.
1:18:31,1:18:39,29ed6943-18c9-4b1d-ab32-b1a83df77d84,If there's ends up being like 20 students during one session or something like making this message and and discord or I can hop on to help on if it's Thursday or Friday.
1:18:40,1:18:44,fa3e5f86-2b2d-49aa-a214-9a84ff89e3bb," yeah i'm gonna i'm gonna be free on all the dates, so if anyone needs to you."
1:18:45,1:19:02,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58," yeah sure I mean even better if it's fair like first we try to do all one, at a time, but if somebody cannot do this, then I mean we can always join, but it's a really good practice, I think, because there will, there will be a lot of students."
1:19:04,1:19:09,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,And I think it's better to practice with more students to see whether your approach is scalable.
1:19:10,1:19:14,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,Because yeah you will tend to exhaust yourself and.
1:19:15,1:19:20,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,it's better to assume there is 2030 students and.
1:19:21,1:19:26,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,They tried to you know I get a lot better with less.
1:19:28,1:19:36,fa3e5f86-2b2d-49aa-a214-9a84ff89e3bb," Okay yeah so who, I guess, whoever has like a day preferences go ahead and fill in first I know they can take what's left."
1:19:37,1:19:41,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58," yeah I can take also what's left, I mean I."
1:19:51,1:19:52,,Like we're done.
1:19:53,1:19:55,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,Okay cool so that means i'm blessed.
1:19:56,1:19:57,0b2e580e-b701-42a7-a355-253910aa8871,posey.
1:19:59,1:20:01,fa3e5f86-2b2d-49aa-a214-9a84ff89e3bb,Thanks alright.
1:20:01,1:20:09,fc07718b-853d-4a8f-8fd8-3c08aa713ede," So do you guys mind if, like other to lurk your thing like i'm tempted to learn here guys just to see how your."
1:20:11,1:20:13,fc07718b-853d-4a8f-8fd8-3c08aa713ede,advice for how I should leave the tutorial.
1:20:13,1:20:14,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,that's fine.
1:20:15,1:20:18,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58," Right, so you mean yeah join me multiple stations."
1:20:18,1:20:19,fc07718b-853d-4a8f-8fd8-3c08aa713ede,yeah like i've.
1:20:19,1:20:21,fc07718b-853d-4a8f-8fd8-3c08aa713ede,got a fly on the wall kind of no camera.
1:20:22,1:20:23,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,Behind yeah.
1:20:25,1:20:29,29ed6943-18c9-4b1d-ab32-b1a83df77d84,who's there was that when we're using them do you mind putting the like clean host ID into.
1:20:29,1:20:32,fa3e5f86-2b2d-49aa-a214-9a84ff89e3bb," Yes, I edited the message, so you should have it."
1:20:33,1:20:35,fa3e5f86-2b2d-49aa-a214-9a84ff89e3bb,In there or something.
1:20:35,1:20:39,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,yeah okay so so if you're sharing the host ID between each other right.
1:20:40,1:20:44,fa3e5f86-2b2d-49aa-a214-9a84ff89e3bb,we're sharing the zoom link and you guys can use that key yeah.
1:20:44,1:20:46,fa3e5f86-2b2d-49aa-a214-9a84ff89e3bb,You can see yeah.
1:20:46,1:20:49,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58," I mean don't share it with yours to others, I guess."
1:20:50,1:20:53,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,We I mean not such a terrible idea but yeah.
1:20:56,1:20:59,fa3e5f86-2b2d-49aa-a214-9a84ff89e3bb,yeah I think that's good um.
1:21:00,1:21:00,fa3e5f86-2b2d-49aa-a214-9a84ff89e3bb," Okay, so."
1:21:01,1:21:04,0b2e580e-b701-42a7-a355-253910aa8871,where's the zoom link and the key are in the discord are.
1:21:05,1:21:07,fa3e5f86-2b2d-49aa-a214-9a84ff89e3bb,There in indigo show ETA chat.
1:21:07,1:21:09,29ed6943-18c9-4b1d-ab32-b1a83df77d84,Do we pin it for now.
1:21:10,1:21:12,fa3e5f86-2b2d-49aa-a214-9a84ff89e3bb," Yes, good idea can I can."
1:21:14,1:21:15,29ed6943-18c9-4b1d-ab32-b1a83df77d84,Maybe you do.
1:21:16,1:21:17,fa3e5f86-2b2d-49aa-a214-9a84ff89e3bb,yeah I cannot.
1:21:18,1:21:18,29ed6943-18c9-4b1d-ab32-b1a83df77d84,Oh yeah I got it.
1:21:22,1:21:23,fa3e5f86-2b2d-49aa-a214-9a84ff89e3bb,You got.
1:21:23,1:21:24,,yeah.
1:21:25,1:21:27,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,The messages here are not shown to the.
1:21:27,1:21:28,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,Students right.
1:21:28,1:21:29,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58," No, no."
1:21:29,1:21:31,fa3e5f86-2b2d-49aa-a214-9a84ff89e3bb,it's private to me yeah yeah.
1:21:33,1:21:37,fa3e5f86-2b2d-49aa-a214-9a84ff89e3bb,I think general is open to students indigo.
1:21:38,1:21:40,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58," Yes, the general one is yeah."
1:21:43,1:21:44,29ed6943-18c9-4b1d-ab32-b1a83df77d84,So maybe.
1:21:45,1:21:45,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,You could maybe.
1:21:46,1:22:02,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58," Perhaps share our questions there like if you didn't get a content like if you have a question about the content, we can, maybe first share their try to answer each other's and then share the content team because probably are going to be slow."
1:22:03,1:22:13,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58," yeah you're all going to be, at the same time right so that's good like we will be probably more fresh than the content team because, like."
1:22:15,1:22:35,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58," They are not the actual content developers, they are just previous year Ts and probably not very fresh so i'm not very optimistic about the content health team, this year, I mean because it's new and let's see if it works out but yeah first let's rely on on ourselves first."
1:22:37,1:22:48,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58," yeah and also like we can do some fun activities as a makeup, but it will be good to you know, try to help each other in terms of difficulties in the content in the general channel."
1:22:50,1:22:58,29ed6943-18c9-4b1d-ab32-b1a83df77d84,yeah is it a cool if I drop this zoom meeting link that we're using for the pre course into the main channel general.
1:22:58,1:23:00,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,By menu in the general for the.

1:24:18,1:24:26,29ed6943-18c9-4b1d-ab32-b1a83df77d84," I guess it's like locked by enemies like main group rush, do you want to like ask them if they'll give you access to like change it, since you're the mega pod later."
1:24:27,1:24:29,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,yeah I mean I should take a habit for that.
1:24:31,1:24:31,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,I can ask.
1:24:32,1:24:34,fa3e5f86-2b2d-49aa-a214-9a84ff89e3bb,You how did you pin it in the other.
1:24:35,1:24:39,29ed6943-18c9-4b1d-ab32-b1a83df77d84,You click the more option on a message that says like pendants.
1:24:39,1:24:40,fa3e5f86-2b2d-49aa-a214-9a84ff89e3bb,has more options okay.
1:24:40,1:24:43,fa3e5f86-2b2d-49aa-a214-9a84ff89e3bb,So I never see that which is interesting.
1:24:43,1:24:45,29ed6943-18c9-4b1d-ab32-b1a83df77d84,huh I do.
1:24:45,1:24:51,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,It in our private one in the like you know pod channel.
1:24:51,1:24:53,fa3e5f86-2b2d-49aa-a214-9a84ff89e3bb,yeah I can't come there either oh.
1:24:56,1:24:57,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,yeah so.
1:24:58,1:25:02,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,How can we get everyone on skirt now like.
1:25:03,1:25:05,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,email them again the ones missing.
1:25:06,1:25:14,fa3e5f86-2b2d-49aa-a214-9a84ff89e3bb," Well, so we don't know yet who's missing until they until they make this part command for us in order to check the users."
1:25:15,1:25:16,fa3e5f86-2b2d-49aa-a214-9a84ff89e3bb,Because there's workbench.
1:25:16,1:25:20,fa3e5f86-2b2d-49aa-a214-9a84ff89e3bb," Yet this court won't show us, who is in the Channel and."
1:25:20,1:25:22,fa3e5f86-2b2d-49aa-a214-9a84ff89e3bb,offline so they're offline or.
1:25:22,1:25:25,fa3e5f86-2b2d-49aa-a214-9a84ff89e3bb,invisible we won't know if they've joined.
1:25:26,1:25:28,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58," By but I found the trick, I think."
1:25:28,1:25:35,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58," them today, so it looks like we can search people here."
1:25:36,1:25:37,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,So.
1:25:37,1:25:39,fa3e5f86-2b2d-49aa-a214-9a84ff89e3bb,I yeah you can search for their name.
1:25:39,1:25:43,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58," that's right the Ad, starting with the ads like you know you can search the name."
1:25:44,1:25:46,fa3e5f86-2b2d-49aa-a214-9a84ff89e3bb,that's true yeah you can search if they're here.
1:25:46,1:25:49,,Like let's I don't know.
1:25:52,1:25:55,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58," it's not here, I guess here as well."
1:25:57,1:26:02,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58," yeah like in your message bar, you can also search people by starting with."
1:26:05,1:26:08,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,yeah that's how I found you guys.
1:26:09,1:26:11,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58," You know, it might be useful."
1:26:11,1:26:13,fc07718b-853d-4a8f-8fd8-3c08aa713ede,That offline people too.
1:26:14,1:26:15,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,I think so yeah.
1:26:16,1:26:17,fa3e5f86-2b2d-49aa-a214-9a84ff89e3bb,Let me try.
1:26:18,1:26:20,fc07718b-853d-4a8f-8fd8-3c08aa713ede," If it does, I know something really is just one person."
1:26:24,1:26:25,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,And also like it.
1:26:27,1:26:29,,shows everyone.
1:26:30,1:26:43,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58," In that place which message before like in each channel when we start with add, I think it shows the people who have messaged there before so it's it's not really."
1:26:44,1:26:47,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,The people who are in this channel is just about.
1:26:47,1:26:48,,People who message.
1:26:49,1:26:52,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,So these still need to search the people who never messaged before.
1:26:58,1:27:09,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,yeah so yeah I guess we just did to just keep emailing until they show an activity somewhere in this court like maybe introduction they introduce themselves.
1:27:16,1:27:23,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58," Better how many students, how many of your students do you expect that they will attend."
1:27:24,1:27:26,fa3e5f86-2b2d-49aa-a214-9a84ff89e3bb,For I think for me.
1:27:26,1:27:27,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,Yours is for.
1:27:27,1:27:28,29ed6943-18c9-4b1d-ab32-b1a83df77d84,Free course.
1:27:29,1:27:30,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,yeah.
1:27:31,1:27:32,29ed6943-18c9-4b1d-ab32-b1a83df77d84,so far.
1:27:33,1:27:33,,that's.
1:27:35,1:27:36,a1958a61-a8ce-4002-9980-c66db01f95fe,At least two.
1:27:38,1:27:39,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,Zero wow.
1:27:39,1:27:43,fc07718b-853d-4a8f-8fd8-3c08aa713ede," Well, I only have one student whose message, and this is not showing up."
1:27:44,1:27:44,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,Oh.
1:27:46,1:27:47,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,Isaac yeah.
1:27:47,1:27:47,,I.
1:27:49,1:27:49,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,Oh that's.
1:27:50,1:27:55,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58," A interesting, so I guess, we are mostly junior part like."
1:27:57,1:28:00,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,yeah so probably a lot of sense.
1:28:00,1:28:02,fc07718b-853d-4a8f-8fd8-3c08aa713ede," I have a mathematics, Professor."
1:28:09,1:28:09,fc07718b-853d-4a8f-8fd8-3c08aa713ede,neuroscience data.
1:28:15,1:28:17,29ed6943-18c9-4b1d-ab32-b1a83df77d84,Professor my last year to.
1:28:17,1:28:22,29ed6943-18c9-4b1d-ab32-b1a83df77d84,He had forced his his graduate students come so he said he did himself to slows more fair.
1:28:23,1:28:24,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,wow.

1:28:33,1:28:37,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,yeah he somehow he got tagged as a super genius.
1:28:39,1:28:43,29ed6943-18c9-4b1d-ab32-b1a83df77d84," I guess, if you like, thought your description saying you don't have any neuroscience experience."
1:28:44,1:28:44,29ed6943-18c9-4b1d-ab32-b1a83df77d84,might get the.
1:28:45,1:28:46,fa3e5f86-2b2d-49aa-a214-9a84ff89e3bb,message yeah.
1:28:46,1:28:50,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,Probably some maybe citations and looked up your Google scholar or.
1:28:52,1:28:53,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,Maybe degrees.
1:28:56,1:28:56,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,yeah.
1:28:56,1:28:57,fc07718b-853d-4a8f-8fd8-3c08aa713ede,Once vacation so I don't know.

1:29:08,1:29:22,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,chill and also more refreshing when they really don't know anything you practice better teaching like they don't ask difficult questions so you can actually as there are a lot of their questions yeah.
1:29:23,1:29:23,,cool.
1:29:25,1:29:28,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,Anything else love to this cause.

1:29:45,1:29:49,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,I just chose my time slot late night.
1:29:50,1:30:04,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58," Because I mean yeah it's hard for me to do my day because i'm still working in the company, so I still have some obligations to do in the morning yeah right."
1:30:06,1:30:06,,cool.
1:30:07,1:30:09,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,Anything else.
1:30:12,1:30:14,fa3e5f86-2b2d-49aa-a214-9a84ff89e3bb,As we're ready for tomorrow.
1:30:15,1:30:16,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,yeah.
1:30:18,1:30:22,0b2e580e-b701-42a7-a355-253910aa8871," So actually after the hour break, then the next person takes takes over right to."
1:30:22,1:30:23,fa3e5f86-2b2d-49aa-a214-9a84ff89e3bb,Teach him yeah.
1:30:24,1:30:30,fa3e5f86-2b2d-49aa-a214-9a84ff89e3bb," And I guess, we can just hang in the chat just let them know next."
1:30:30,1:30:33,fc07718b-853d-4a8f-8fd8-3c08aa713ede,Is the hour America like specific time or just when the students feel like it.
1:30:34,1:30:36,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58," Ah, no specific time."
1:30:40,1:30:46,a1958a61-a8ce-4002-9980-c66db01f95fe," I think it's an iron after the first session, and then the hour break and it's there are half second session."
1:30:49,1:30:51,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,one hour 45 minutes.
1:30:51,1:30:54,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,Like like he wasn't the slide that break down.
1:30:55,1:30:55,fa3e5f86-2b2d-49aa-a214-9a84ff89e3bb,Not the same.
1:30:55,1:30:59,fa3e5f86-2b2d-49aa-a214-9a84ff89e3bb,schedule is like a normal day just without the intro and natural.
1:31:01,1:31:05,fc07718b-853d-4a8f-8fd8-3c08aa713ede," yeah yes, like in the slides that they presented that word schedule like."
1:31:05,1:31:09,a1958a61-a8ce-4002-9980-c66db01f95fe,Right yeah hour 45 minute and our break and i'm afraid.
1:31:10,1:31:13,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,yeah and I think they're supposed to be watching to our true.
1:31:15,1:31:21,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58," haha no, there is no i'll try after before the break yeah so there's only after after the second session."
1:31:22,1:31:25,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,So they're gonna be watching intros and outros separately by themselves.
1:31:26,1:31:40,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58," But I think we should really encourage them because they usually don't, so we should maybe start the day with checking and asking questions discussing the intro because because you really interest really important in terms of."
1:31:42,1:31:49,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58," Being actually doing the content, the ultra is not that important it's usually high level like research directions and."
1:31:51,1:32:00,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58," I mean it's good about not super essential to do, for example, the next day, because each days usually different so Delta, is not that essential to do the next day."
1:32:01,1:32:12,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58," But your intro is like a super important some of them are really heavy it will be even better if we asked them to watch of days before like one day before, rather than just before the."
1:32:13,1:32:19,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,Exercise because sometimes they need to spend more time and go and learn more and.
1:32:20,1:32:23,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,Like they might have a questions to ask.
1:32:24,1:32:34,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58," So so before each day, we should, I think, say go watch out for an intro of the next day and start asking questions in the discord."
1:32:36,1:32:40,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58," And yeah make sure you know and practice, the intro context."
1:32:43,1:32:44,,yeah.
1:33:14,1:33:21,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,So are we gonna do that thing that I said that be create one post.
1:33:23,1:33:28,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,For each session and then ask people to thumbs up for that session.
1:33:30,1:33:42,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58," So that we can actually keep track of how people are coming in each day because some people, students, some students some students emailed me that they're coming only sometimes some days."
1:33:43,1:33:47,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,So that's also helpful to keep track of how many people are coming.
1:33:48,1:33:52,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,yeah so so then each person each person during that session can.
1:33:53,1:34:00,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58," Post and we will sequentially post after another, in the same order, it will kind of be spamming their."
1:34:02,1:34:04,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,application and also allowing them to.
1:34:06,1:34:07,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,Up separately.
1:34:10,1:34:16,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,So the first person I think Isaac you're gonna write the boiler plates that we will copy and paste.
1:34:20,1:34:21,0b2e580e-b701-42a7-a355-253910aa8871,No pressure haha.
1:34:21,1:34:21,,Oh.
1:34:22,1:34:27,0b2e580e-b701-42a7-a355-253910aa8871,yeah so i'm just gonna say thumbs up if you plan on attending or do you want me to.
1:34:27,1:34:30,0b2e580e-b701-42a7-a355-253910aa8871,give an introduction to just introduce yourself.
1:34:30,1:34:34,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,And you will be doing this happy too excited to.
1:34:36,1:34:37,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,Give a thumbs up if you wanna.
1:34:39,1:34:41,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,If you are joining my session.
1:34:42,1:34:46,0b2e580e-b701-42a7-a355-253910aa8871," Okay, and then everyone else will sequentially say in my session is here, sums up."
1:34:47,1:34:55,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58," yeah okay yeah let's not make it to personas that we can actually copy paste if you make your papers, it will be plagiarism if the topic."
1:34:56,1:35:00,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,So it is Hello i'm already like Mrs i'll be.
1:35:01,1:35:04,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,Your session ta for this.
1:35:05,1:35:08,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,Give a thumbs up if you're going to go.
1:35:09,1:35:13,0b2e580e-b701-42a7-a355-253910aa8871," Okay, should we do, should we do sessions or days like day one day."
1:35:13,1:35:15,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58," sessions, we are dividing per session."
1:35:15,1:35:16,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,Right so because.
1:35:17,1:35:21,fa3e5f86-2b2d-49aa-a214-9a84ff89e3bb," Yes, okay one second one for us yeah."
1:35:21,1:35:28,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58," So we are allowing them like super flexibility so that they can even choose to our blogs, not the whole day."
1:35:30,1:35:38,0b2e580e-b701-42a7-a355-253910aa8871,yeah I just think there might be more questions created like oh what's what's the first session what's the second session for each day how do I know which one to sign up for.
1:35:38,1:35:48,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,Oh alright so yeah give the name of the contents like people say session one of calculus or session to of linear algebra.
1:35:49,1:35:53,29ed6943-18c9-4b1d-ab32-b1a83df77d84,But they've never seen a notebooks they don't know the format of like sessions and like tutorials and that kind of thing.
1:35:55,1:35:55,29ed6943-18c9-4b1d-ab32-b1a83df77d84,they like.
1:35:56,1:35:58,29ed6943-18c9-4b1d-ab32-b1a83df77d84,To be one on linear algebra.
1:36:00,1:36:11,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58," But I think yeah they don't need to go look up the format just yet they just need to know how much time you will take, we just need to say each session is like two hour."
1:36:11,1:36:23,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58," And we will do linear algebra like how we do it is a surprise to them like they just need to decide whether they know the topic, they are available, and I mean they like you're not."
1:36:25,1:36:26,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,As I don't think.
1:36:26,1:36:27,fa3e5f86-2b2d-49aa-a214-9a84ff89e3bb,Is there a way to be.
1:36:29,1:36:34,fa3e5f86-2b2d-49aa-a214-9a84ff89e3bb,Is there a way to create a time that will show up as local time in discord.
1:36:35,1:36:37,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,Oh yeah that will be really helpful as.
1:36:37,1:36:43,fa3e5f86-2b2d-49aa-a214-9a84ff89e3bb," possible, because then we could then we could just say what session one is like this."
1:36:43,1:36:44,fa3e5f86-2b2d-49aa-a214-9a84ff89e3bb,From here.
1:36:44,1:36:45,fa3e5f86-2b2d-49aa-a214-9a84ff89e3bb," From this time, this time."
1:36:48,1:36:52,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,Why or how but we just pin the schedule of every day.
1:36:53,1:36:55,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,I keep referring to it.
1:36:56,1:36:56,fc07718b-853d-4a8f-8fd8-3c08aa713ede,Because like.
1:36:57,1:36:58,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,Ah yeah.
1:37:05,1:37:19,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58," Okay, then let's be clear for the first time, like let's give actually time slots for the for the refresher but i'll find a way to keep reminding them of that schedule every day."
1:37:27,1:37:28,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,isn't that better.
1:37:29,1:37:29,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,than thumbs up.
1:37:35,1:37:39,0b2e580e-b701-42a7-a355-253910aa8871,send it to the mega pod you're saying calendar invite.
1:37:39,1:37:41,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,yeah so for for each.
1:37:41,1:37:47,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58," of our sessions, he will create a calendar invite so that you know if they're joining."
1:37:47,1:37:53,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,They say yes appear exactly how much time is it and we will know how many people are joining.
1:37:56,1:37:59,fa3e5f86-2b2d-49aa-a214-9a84ff89e3bb,So that I don't be I think that'll create.
1:38:02,1:38:05,fa3e5f86-2b2d-49aa-a214-9a84ff89e3bb,That would be like six invites.
1:38:05,1:38:15,29ed6943-18c9-4b1d-ab32-b1a83df77d84," yeah I think it's more of it like if if given the numbers of who we have right now like, if I know Max 20 people like I think it's good for me like it's actually change what i'm going to do, and then."
1:38:16,1:38:23,29ed6943-18c9-4b1d-ab32-b1a83df77d84," If I have like a lot of people I can just email on the discord or someone's available to income join, because we are all the ways you can't join what's the point of."
1:38:24,1:38:24,29ed6943-18c9-4b1d-ab32-b1a83df77d84,me la.
1:38:24,1:38:27,29ed6943-18c9-4b1d-ab32-b1a83df77d84,Tony or five students like i'm still going to.
1:38:28,1:38:31,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,Work last doesn't make so much sense to know how many people are joining.
1:38:31,1:38:41,29ed6943-18c9-4b1d-ab32-b1a83df77d84,And for the students like they're they're so confused right now I like they're all messaged me about like this little thing that little thing and I don't want to create something else for them to worry about like a.
1:38:43,1:38:44,29ed6943-18c9-4b1d-ab32-b1a83df77d84,Like here's the zoom room if you're going to the.
1:38:44,1:38:50,29ed6943-18c9-4b1d-ab32-b1a83df77d84," Pre course you just use this every day, you know and it'll be seven if you want to drop in or now or whatever like."
1:38:51,1:38:51,a1958a61-a8ce-4002-9980-c66db01f95fe,yeah.
1:38:52,1:38:53,29ed6943-18c9-4b1d-ab32-b1a83df77d84," Full simpler, but doesn't have to be."
1:38:54,1:39:01,29ed6943-18c9-4b1d-ab32-b1a83df77d84," we're not going to see these people again, you know we're going to see like eight of them 10 of them it'll be a complete different groups and then we'll have like our own formats and everything."
1:39:03,1:39:04,29ed6943-18c9-4b1d-ab32-b1a83df77d84,I don't know.
1:39:04,1:39:06,0b2e580e-b701-42a7-a355-253910aa8871,I feel yeah I agree with that.
1:39:07,1:39:15,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58," But, but then, how do we make sure that they are actually know the timing, because it's their first time probably they're gonna some of them are gonna be confused about the schedule."
1:39:17,1:39:17,a1958a61-a8ce-4002-9980-c66db01f95fe,Maybe.
1:39:19,1:39:19,29ed6943-18c9-4b1d-ab32-b1a83df77d84,Like.
1:39:20,1:39:26,29ed6943-18c9-4b1d-ab32-b1a83df77d84,You know the day starts at 130 Eastern time and I tell them to convert it into their own time zone if they're not in in my time zone.
1:39:26,1:39:27,29ed6943-18c9-4b1d-ab32-b1a83df77d84,And then.
1:39:28,1:39:32,29ed6943-18c9-4b1d-ab32-b1a83df77d84,We can just tell them the second don't take like an hour break whoever's that day.
1:39:33,1:39:40,29ed6943-18c9-4b1d-ab32-b1a83df77d84," or in discord recruiters message, the second session starting at I think what is it like a 4:30pm Eastern or something like that."
1:39:41,1:39:42,,yeah.
1:39:44,1:39:45,a1958a61-a8ce-4002-9980-c66db01f95fe,we're just an.
1:39:45,1:39:48,a1958a61-a8ce-4002-9980-c66db01f95fe,hour before each session starts so.
1:39:48,1:39:55,a1958a61-a8ce-4002-9980-c66db01f95fe,yeah like the day for the first session is like an hour before your session supposed to start just remind everyone that starts in an hour.
1:39:55,1:39:55,a1958a61-a8ce-4002-9980-c66db01f95fe,And then.
1:39:57,1:40:02,a1958a61-a8ce-4002-9980-c66db01f95fe,For the second session whenever it goes to break just be like will rejoin in an hour and like this.
1:40:02,1:40:07,29ed6943-18c9-4b1d-ab32-b1a83df77d84," like that, because then they don't have to worry about converting times you know they just know okay one hour for whatever it is right now."
1:40:08,1:40:12,0b2e580e-b701-42a7-a355-253910aa8871," How about I like that, and then maybe just right now, as the first day."
1:40:12,1:40:18,0b2e580e-b701-42a7-a355-253910aa8871,i'll just send an kind of an overview of how the next three days are going to work there's going to be three different.
1:40:19,1:40:25,0b2e580e-b701-42a7-a355-253910aa8871,sessions on linear algebra calculus and statistics it's going to be five hours with an hour break in between.
1:40:25,1:40:27,0b2e580e-b701-42a7-a355-253910aa8871,And then we'll.
1:40:27,1:40:28,0b2e580e-b701-42a7-a355-253910aa8871,send out more information.
1:40:29,1:40:29,29ed6943-18c9-4b1d-ab32-b1a83df77d84,In one zoom.
1:40:30,1:40:31,0b2e580e-b701-42a7-a355-253910aa8871,type of thing.
1:40:31,1:40:31,,You have.
1:40:32,1:40:33,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,To get this.
1:40:33,1:40:34,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,Time right.
1:40:38,1:40:40,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,Which is going to be the same every day for them like.
1:40:40,1:40:42,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,That start time is going to be fixed every day.
1:40:43,1:40:48,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58," So they just kind of really, really need to remember converted bonds and sticky."
1:40:51,1:40:54,a1958a61-a8ce-4002-9980-c66db01f95fe,Can you schedule send messages and discord.
1:40:55,1:40:55,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,The.
1:40:56,1:40:57,,question.

1:42:27,1:42:29,fa3e5f86-2b2d-49aa-a214-9a84ff89e3bb,yeah it's gonna be and.
1:42:30,1:42:36,29ed6943-18c9-4b1d-ab32-b1a83df77d84," I think if you're doing for a session that you can just let us know, and we still showed up like a we have a rough ballpark rest of the week."
1:42:36,1:42:43,0b2e580e-b701-42a7-a355-253910aa8871,yeah i'll i'll let you guys know if it is 30 like I don't think it'll be too much for disaster right it's just self paced.
1:42:43,1:42:53,0b2e580e-b701-42a7-a355-253910aa8871," mostly with with answering questions intermittently so I mean if there is some wild influx that we hadn't foreseen, then we can adjust after that maybe have to ta is at the next session next day."
1:42:54,1:42:54,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,Okay.
1:42:57,1:42:57,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,Are you gonna.
1:43:00,1:43:00,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,who's going to be.
1:43:02,1:43:05,0b2e580e-b701-42a7-a355-253910aa8871," Now I hadn't planned on that, but I can also say."
1:43:08,1:43:09,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,I think will be better so.
1:43:09,1:43:09,,That.
1:43:10,1:43:12,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58," You know, they can expect."
1:43:13,1:43:13,0b2e580e-b701-42a7-a355-253910aa8871,Okay.
1:43:13,1:43:16,0b2e580e-b701-42a7-a355-253910aa8871," Sure, maybe i'll do an introduction to like mega."
1:43:20,1:43:20,0b2e580e-b701-42a7-a355-253910aa8871,mega pod.
1:43:21,1:43:29,0b2e580e-b701-42a7-a355-253910aa8871,Five different groups type of thing we're gonna we're gonna do a rotation all these these five teams that are within our pod or mega pot here.
1:43:30,1:43:38,0b2e580e-b701-42a7-a355-253910aa8871,Because do they have an idea of what the mega pot is you are they completely blind to how they have they have a group of 12 and a group of what 30 of.
1:43:38,1:43:39,fa3e5f86-2b2d-49aa-a214-9a84ff89e3bb,yeah I have no idea.
1:43:40,1:43:44,29ed6943-18c9-4b1d-ab32-b1a83df77d84,They know they know nothing they don't even know what a pod is so.
1:43:44,1:43:49,fa3e5f86-2b2d-49aa-a214-9a84ff89e3bb," yeah, why are they using this like pod language you know."
1:43:50,1:43:50,0b2e580e-b701-42a7-a355-253910aa8871,So then.
1:43:51,1:43:53,fc07718b-853d-4a8f-8fd8-3c08aa713ede," it's big in tech companies, I think that's where they got it from."
1:43:54,1:44:01,0b2e580e-b701-42a7-a355-253910aa8871,So then maybe I should just keep it simple not described any of that and just kind of just described that there's going to be multiple teaching sessions.
1:44:01,1:44:08,0b2e580e-b701-42a7-a355-253910aa8871,And then each PA can kind of introduce themselves as they go where do you think we should try to provide more information about this.
1:44:10,1:44:14,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,I think if they give the list of the cia's.
1:44:16,1:44:17,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,They will feel more.
1:44:19,1:44:22,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58," excited to join, because they see their ta right."
1:44:23,1:44:24,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,Like if you post.
1:44:24,1:44:26,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,Then other students feel like you know they're not.
1:44:29,1:44:30,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,So.
1:44:31,1:44:32,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,Just.
1:44:32,1:44:32,fa3e5f86-2b2d-49aa-a214-9a84ff89e3bb,At least mentioned.
1:44:33,1:44:37,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58," you're all gonna be there, your team is going to be there."
1:44:38,1:44:43,0b2e580e-b701-42a7-a355-253910aa8871," Okay, how about this i'm just going to come up with an international message i'll send it into our ta and then we can get."
1:44:43,1:44:46,0b2e580e-b701-42a7-a355-253910aa8871,comments and iterate on a final group message to send them.
1:44:47,1:44:48,41327c6b-fe54-449a-94aa-09f0b291dd58,Okay.
1:44:59,1:45:00,0b2e580e-b701-42a7-a355-253910aa8871,Good.
