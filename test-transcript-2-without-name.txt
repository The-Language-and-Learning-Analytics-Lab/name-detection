22

00:31:50.520 --> 00:32:14.370

AA: and also the project GA will be coming sometime during the schedule actually he was planning to come in the first hour that we missed, so he texted me that Where are you and yeah that was unfortunate, but he said after I joined another session i'll come to your session sometime again.



23

00:32:15.840 --> 00:32:17.970

AA: So we need to make sure we see him today.



24

00:32:19.980 --> 00:32:21.630

AA: Now let's see.



25

00:32:22.680 --> 00:32:37.860

AA: What is the daily plan, so the project track is similar to the tutorial track it has its own certification, we take attendance, let me show you the attendance place as well.



26

00:32:39.510 --> 00:32:44.550

AA: So here, I take attendance in the same place, but it has two sheets.



27

00:32:47.040 --> 00:32:51.000

AA: So I will just put a number from zero to one.



28

00:32:52.950 --> 00:32:57.990

AA: And then, overall, if the sum is less than.



29

00:32:59.340 --> 00:33:18.300

AA: Two days of absentees then that doesn't qualify for that certification and they have their own separate certification, so if you are regularly attending the tutorials and missing some projects us you're still eligible for the editorial certification.



30

00:33:19.410 --> 00:33:32.010

AA: And for for how I take attendance during the projects because I will not be here, most of the time during the projects, I will just join in the first 30 minutes.
